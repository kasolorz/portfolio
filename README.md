This humble and basic page (only HTML5 and CSS3), is part of the assignments from the Free Web Development Bootcamp sponsored by classcentral.com, coordinated by @jessicarose, and certified by freecodecamp.com. During the last days of the Bootcamp the hype was the screenings of Matrix Resurrections; it came very handy as a symbol of what the Bootcamp meant to me. Matrix Resurrections felt very much like me in this time: old and forced to reinvent myself to cope with the new reality, but also in order to struggle efficiently, move on, and enjoy it at once. So I very much played with the Matrix aesthetics, something I also recently did in my Redbubble shop, as a way to open myself to the world and leave behind a strong analogic, paper&ink past (If that is somewhat possible).
